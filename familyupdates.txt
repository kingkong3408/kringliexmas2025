The “lost Christmas cards” details you want included (anything beyond Bismarck↔Jamestown):
Order our Christmas cards from Shutterfly in November as we always do. Weeks went by without and update other than they had left some town in Arizona. Finally and update on December 6th that somehow between Bismarck, ND and Jamestown, ND our box full of Christmas cards became empty and UPS just discarded the empty box. After contacting Shutterfly, they told be the soonest they could reprint and sent would be after January 1st. So....we are now digital Christmas cards.
