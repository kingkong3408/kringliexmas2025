        <p class="muted">In lew of the now blowing in the wind Shutterly cards...</p>

          <p class="stanza dropcap">
          'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house,<br>
          Were stockings and garlands—and one overachieving… Susan-mouse.<br>
          She'd toasted the season (then toasted it twice),<br>
          With Halloween totes and Thanksgiving packed tight,<br>
          Now Christmas totes out—stacked up <em>just right</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            She's year two working from home (Northern Plains Lab, Bismarck-way),<br>
            In slippers and spreadsheets, still crushing the workday.<br>
            But when tennis rolls around? She's back on the court,<br>
            Coaching Hi-Liners with hustle—no “off-season” report.<br>
            USTA volunteering? Oh yes, that's her jam:<br>
            Northern Section <em>and</em> National—she's got the whole plan.<br>
            And while she's decorating like Santa's interior designer,<br>
            The boys crack wise… like it's their seasonal assignment.
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            Then Hale burst in next with a “grain” of good cheer,<br>
            Arthur Companies' Pillsbury plant keeps him busy all year.<br>
            Grain merchandiser life: it's fast, it's intense—<br>
            He can talk markets and yields like it's Christmas in French.<br>
            But he found time for pheasants out west on the plains,<br>
            And came home with stories (and frostcicles on his face).<br>
            And plot twist of 2025—hold onto your hat—<br>
            He bought a new home! How about that?<br>
            Just three blocks from Grandma Kay—what a win—<br>
            Close enough for cookies, but still his own den.
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            Now Kai, our Cobber, in Moorhead he stays,<br>
            Third year at Concordia—tennis for days.<br>
            He traveled to Mexico City (Finance class, Fall break),<br>
            Came back with big stories—Aztec on the brain.<br>
            And summertime? MudPumpers—Dilworth—no joke,<br>
            Leveling concrete so springtime won't turn driveways to wobble and woe.<br>
            We chased Cobber tennis to Orlando in March,<br>
            USTA National Campus—sunburn and starch.
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            And Erik… well Erik… he lives to be <strong>eckle</strong>,<br>
            Still lives and still dies by the Red Sox… ha-ha.<br>
            Year twenty-eight at VCSU—data centers to tame,<br>
            Director of Data Centers: same boss-level game.<br>
            He coaches Hi-Liners (both girls and boys),<br>
            And runs Valley City Tennis—spreading tennis joy.<br>
            He even got certified—USTA official on deck,<br>
            Calling lines like a pro (with a tasteful eye-check).<br>
            Though February brought hip surgery—ouch, not a blast—<br>
            He bounced back determined, still moving quite fast. 😉
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            And meanwhile the pets kept their schedule just right:<br>
            Chief (eight) loves walks and pizza—a true holiday knight,<br>
            Hot dogs and Red Sox with Dad on the couch,<br>
            He'll stare at the screen like he's scouting the team.<br>
            Tessie (now nine) is a neighborhood queen,<br>
            Eating us broke, then prowling unseen.<br>
            And Frank (five) has a plan that is simple and tight:<br>
            Sleep… eat… sleep… and then sleep through the night.
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            But wait—what's this rumble? A tale to be told—<br>
            Our cards went on tour like a legend of old.<br>
            We ordered from Shutterfly, November as usual,<br>
            Then waited… and waited… it got kind of cruel.<br>
            “Some town in Arizona,” the tracking would say,<br>
            Like the cards took a detour for a spa day.
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            Then December the sixth—oh the plot took a twist—<br>
            Between Bismarck and Jamestown… the box got dismissed.<br>
            Not “delivered,” not “lost,” not “oops, on a truck”—<br>
            But <strong>empty</strong>—and UPS said, “Welp. Good luck.”<br>
            They tossed the sad box like it wasn't a thing—<br>
            A cardboard shell of our holiday wing.
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            We called up Shutterfly: “Can you reprint and send?”<br>
            They said, “Sure! After January first, friend.”<br>
            So here we are now, with a digital cheer,<br>
            A website Christmas card—because delivery's weird.
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            So from our crew to yours, may your season be bright,<br>
            May your packages arrive, and your tracking be right.<br>
            May your toasts be delicious (Old Fashions by the fire),<br>
            May your Sox win in October (Erik will pray—then get louder).<br>
            And if UPS calls… tell them this, with a grin:<br>
            “Check Interstate 94—between Jamestown… and Bismarck again.”<br>
            You might just find a Kringlie card… all frosted in the ditch—<br>
            Still spreading Christmas cheer… because UPS is <strong>eckle</strong> like that.
